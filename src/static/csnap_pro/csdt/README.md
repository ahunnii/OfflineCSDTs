# Overriding Snap with CSnap Functionality

This quickly goes over the proper procedure for overriding the base application with our own functionality.
First, all of our changes reside in ./csdt, in the root of ./csnap.
Core is where the base application overrides reside
Blocks are just new blocks that are added (mostly generic one offs)
AI is where our AI functionality resides.
STL is where our STL functionality resides.
