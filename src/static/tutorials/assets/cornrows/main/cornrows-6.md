- Take your braid (the &#39;repeat&#39; block) and put it inside another repeat block
- After each braid, you will need to set size, angle, and position
- To make the size larger, use the &#39;scale by&#39; block in your repeat loop after your braid, and make the number &gt;100% (try 300)
- To reset the angle your can use the &#39;point at angle&#39; block
