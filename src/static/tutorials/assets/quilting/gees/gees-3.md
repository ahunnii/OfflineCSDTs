- You can actually repeat your code, using ![repeat](./img/repeat.png) Given a number of times to repeat, any other blocks inside will repeat. For Geeâ€™s Bend quilts, you can use this to change the scaling and color of each stamp as you repeat it.
- The ![scale by factor](./img/scalebyfactor.png) block will take the current size of the sprite, and scale it up or down by a given percentage. So for example, if you have your program scale by 90 each time, then the sprite will scale down by 90% of its current size. This gives you smaller and smaller stamps with each iteration (repeat).
- The ![set color effect](./img/setcoloreffect.png) block allows you to change the color of your sprite. Given a value (0 to 100), you can give your sprite a new color.
