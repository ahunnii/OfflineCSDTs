- To start your project, you need to use ![""](./img/whenClicked_block.png) Anything attached to the block will run when the green flag is clicked. The green flag can be found above the stage, or in the block itself.
- To clear your stage of all stamps and pen trails, use ![""](./img/clear_block.png)
- To move your sprite, use ![""](./img/goTo.png) To move up, use a positive y value. To move down, use a negative value. To move left, use a negative x value. To move right, use a positive value.
- To rotate your sprite, use ![""](./img/pointatblock.png) It rotates to the angle that you give it.
- These blocks will initialize(set up) your script, and allow you to start stamping your sprite onto the stage.
