You can change what your sprite looks like! The first thing you can change is the color of your sprite, using ![""](./img/setcoloreffect.png) Think of the color spectrum (ROYGBIV). The block takes a number value from 0 to 100, startinig with red at 0. ![""](./img/colorwheel.png) The ![""](./img/setghost.png) block allows you to change the transparency of your sprite. Keeping it at 0 will keep the sprite opaque, while changing the number to 100 will make it transparent (ghostly). **With the color effect block, you can click on its dropdown, and select 'ghost' to utilize the ghost effect.**
