Why circles?

_'Everything the Power of the World does is done in a circle.... Birds make their nest in circles, for theirs is the same religion as ours. The sun comes forth and goes down again in a circle.... The life of a man is a circle from childhood to childhood, and so it is in everything where power moves. Our tepees were round like the nests of birds, and these were always set in a circle, the nation's hoopâ€™._
_John Neihardt: Black Elk Speaks: Being the Life Story of a Holy Man of the Oglala Sioux (1961)_

With this in mind, you can add more circles to this design. Note how that simulation script allows a nice visualization of how the circles expand, with one more translation/stamp in each radius. You can even introduce new colors this way as well.
