- Let's exit our nested loops and attach the following blocks after the loops:
- Drag the purple 'set color effect to \_' block and attach it at the bottom of the script
- Set the color effect to 3, the same color as the row of stitches at y = 0
- Drag in the blue 'Go to stitch x* y *' block and set x to -1 and y to 5
- Under the mint green pen menu, drag in the 'iso triangle' block and set it to '1 stitches every 1 rows for 7 total direction -y'
- Finally, drag in another 'go to stitch x _ y _' blue block and set the value to something offscreen, like x = 23 and y = 11. This will prevent our turtle costume from lingering on screen and looking like an aberrant stitch
