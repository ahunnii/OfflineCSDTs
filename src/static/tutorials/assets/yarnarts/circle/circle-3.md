- You can now see that there are two repeat loops, creating two circles. The second loop has 12 iterations, and we know from our last experiment that it needs a 30 degree rotation angle. In crochet itâ€™s a general rule of thumb (what computer scientists call a `heuristic`) that no matter what number 'n ' you start with, you can add 6 in each succeeding circle. Since we started with n=6, our next circle should have n=12, then 18, and so on. For any `n` the rotation angle is always 360/n.
- You can change the color simply by dragging the `change color effect` block between the two repeat loops.
- Finally, you can add more circles by right-clicking on the `stamp` block between the two repeat loops, selecting `duplicate` or the graphic representation of the code in a small image, and adding those blocks at the bottom of the script. Don`t forget to add 6 to the new repeat loop(making n = 18), and change the angle according to 360 / 18 = 20.
- Adding one repeat loop at a time is pretty tedious, but now that we know the rules for making new circles, we can put a circle-making loop inside another loop, making many circles with a small script. When you are ready click on the next step, Many Circles. Let's start from scratch.</li >
