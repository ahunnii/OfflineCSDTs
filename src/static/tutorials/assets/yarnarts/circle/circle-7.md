- Remember `Radius` is the number of circles away from the center we're stitching
- `circ` is the number of stitches in the circle. This changes by 6 for every increase in radius
- We need to add the orange `change __ by __` block at the end of our outer loop twice for each variable, circ and Radius
- Change Radius by 1 each loop
- Change circ by 6 each loop
- Add a blue `go to x: 0 y: 0` block outside of the loop too
- This concludes our tutorial. Add a `change color effect` block if you want to change the color based on the radius or another variable
