- Start with a blank template: one `When flag clicked` and one `clear` block
- Attach the purple `Set size to __` block and set it to 7%
- Go to the brown variable menu and click `make new variable`
- In the name variable window, type `radius`
- Do the same thing for a `circ` variable
- Drag in and attach the brown `set ___ to __` twice and set the first to `Radius` and the second to `circ` using the drop down menu in the block.
- Drag in a yellow `loop` block and attach it to the bottom. Let's fill it in using our variables!
