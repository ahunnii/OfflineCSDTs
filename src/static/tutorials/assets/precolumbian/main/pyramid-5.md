We need to move up in 3 dimensional space each time we finish a square grid with the two inner loops. Drop in a blue 'change y by 20' block to move up. We need to shrink our layers, so that they regress 9x9, 8x8, 7x7, ..., giving us the pyramid shape. Let's do that by subtracting one from SideLength. Drop in the orange 'Change _ by _' block and select SideLength from the dropdown menu. Set 'by' to -1. This means our inner loops are decreasing becoming smaller squares, because they loop and accordingly stamp blocks for smaller and smaller amounts. We need to slightly modify our starting coordinates for our blocks layer after layer. Otherwise, they'll all be pushed to one side. Let's change StartX by 10 and also change StartZ by 10. 10 is half a block. This means we'll be shifting towards the center of the pyramid by half a block each new layer. This is perfect because we're removing one row and one column of each layer by changing SideLength by -1. This will be evenly spaced all around the pyramid. Finally, because our z axis controlling loop just finished, we need to carriage return in the z axis. Drag in a blue 'Set z to _' block and set it to the orange oval for our variable 'StartZ'. Because we also changed StartX by 10 right above, we need to 'reload' it with the new value in the x axis, so drag in a blue 'set x to _' and drop in the orange variable for 'StartX'
