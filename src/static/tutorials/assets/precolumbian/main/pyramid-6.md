The graphic has you place a go to x: y: z: with StartX, StartY, and StartZ, but this isn't necessary. Drop in a purple 'switch to costume' block and choose from the dropdown 'stork'. Drop in a purple 'scale to x: _ y: _ z: _' block and set all values to 0.2. This sets the size of the stork. You can change this if you feel like it. We need another blue 'go to x: _ y: _ z: _' block. Set x to 30, y to 90, and z to 90. This sets the position of the stork.
