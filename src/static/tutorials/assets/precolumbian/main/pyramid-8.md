If your pyramid doesn't look the same, be sure to debug it by cross referencing the complete script below to what you have in your window. Check to make sure all the variables are the same, the coordinates are equal, and the control structure is the same (loops within loops are within each other, not adjacent, and vice versa). Use the script below to make sure your code is perfect. If everything works, take a break, then click 'Create My Own' to open the simulator where you can create your own pyramid designs and shapes. Save them to the cloud then send to your friends to show off your code!
