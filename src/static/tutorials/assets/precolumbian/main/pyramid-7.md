Add a blue 'angle x: 0 y: 0 z: 0' block to make sure we are pointing at the right angle. We need to make our bird circle around. First, we need to tell the program which axis to rotate around. Then we need to set the center of the turn to a slight distance away from the bird, so that it looks like its flying in a wide circle, instead of just spinning in place. Drop in a yellow 'repeat until _' control block. This uses an event to signal the loop to stop. The sky blue blocks are events. Choose 'mouse down?' and drop it into the hexagon shape on the control block. This makes the loop run until the user clicks the mouse button, after clicking the green flag in the top right of the screen. We need to program some action in our loop. Drop in the blue 'rotate x: _ y: _ z: _' and set x to zero, y to 1, and z to 0. This will rotate along the y axis, which if you twist the y axis (height) you make the stork spin like a ballerina.. Let's add some depth to our spin radius to make the stork circle instead of spin. Drop in a blue 'translate by _ of _' block and set 'by' to -1 and for the second text input type 'depth'. This shifts the stork on the z axis, which shifts it left so the encircling has a wider arc.
