Use the purple 'switch to costume' block to select box, which is the stone square that makes up our pyramid. Next, drag in the purple 'scale to x: _ y: _ z: _' block and set all values to 0.2. This sets the appropriate scale for our pyramid. Change these values to change the size. We need to use our variables to specify a starting place. Drag in a 'go to x: _ y: _ z: _' block and then drag in the orange ovals corresponding with our StartX, StartY, and StartY into the appropriate x, y, or z value. Because variables are integers, and the required type of the goto block are integer values, you can drop the variables into the block's requested value parameters.
