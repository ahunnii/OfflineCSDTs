- We are now going to create some lines.
- Duplicate the "go to bead x", "go to bead y", "point towards angle" blocks.
- The y position should be -11 and the angle should be -45 degrees.
- Update the last brightness block to be 0.
- Use a "line" block with a bead length of 6.
- This will create a line of beads that are 6 beads long.
